Counts Number Occurences
SELECT COUNT(*) as cnt, unnest(tag2) as untag FROM articles GROUP BY untag;

Better
SELECT DISTINCT unnest(tag2) FROM articles;

Works:
SELECT unnest(tag2) FROM articles;


List all articles with all tags
SELECT *, unnest(tag2) FROM articles;




Returns list of tags with only aid = 12
SELECT * FROM (SELECT unnest(tag2) as untag FROM articles) t JOIN articles a ON (untag = ANY(a.tag2));

SELECT * FROM articles WHERE 'admin' = ANY (tag2);

Find item in array and show aid
SELECT * FROM
   (SELECT aid, tag2,
           generate_subscripts(tag2, 1) AS s
      FROM articles) AS untag
 WHERE tag2[s] = 'cool';

Find item in array
SELECT * FROM
   (SELECT tag2,
           generate_subscripts(tag2, 1) AS s
      FROM articles) AS untag
 WHERE tag2[s] = 'admin';



SELECT DISTINCT tag FROM articles; 
SELECT ARRAY_AGG(DISTINCT tag) AS tag FROM articles;

SELECT array_unique(tag) FROM articles;



create or replace function public.array_unique(arr anyarray)
returns anyarray as $body$
    select array( select distinct unnest($1) )
$body$ language 'sql';



select unnest(ports) as port, count(*) from foo group by port;

SELECT port, count(*) AS ct
FROM   tbl t, unnest(t.ports) AS port  -- implicit LATERAL join
GROUP  BY port;
