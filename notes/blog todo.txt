	Make the template() function take a String instead of a &str
		The String will not be used anymore so its ok to move its ownership
		The &str needed to be converted to a String anyways
		NEVERMIND - passing in a &str is better
			Passing as a string needs to pass it as a reference anyways
			Only thing it does it erase the passed in variable when it doesnt need to
	
	Auto resize the article body text box height when text height is larger than the box's
	Style the insert form with bootstrap forms
	
	Maybe add a number of tabs at the beginning of each line of body text in the template() function
		The number of tabs to be determined by the layout
	
	IMPORTANT
	url_decode() the strings FromForm implementation for ArticleForm
		They are being saved as url_encoded() strings in the database

	JAVASCRIPT
	Add a second password box that has no placeholder text and has display: none
		when form is submitted set display: none to current password box and enable the hdiden one
	Also set submit button to disablabled after validating


	Add a method/helper function to retrieve an article and user from a qry
		retrieve the data from the raw qry
		returns a result <Article/User, String>
		maybe make a trait that defines methods on Strings?? for retrieving stuff like
			.retrieve_article()
	
	Add Tls/Ssl using Let's Encrypt

	Sanitizing strings
	Make an actual layout
	Maybe implement a cache
	maybe implement a file cache
		This would allow files to be served even when the url
		is a folder in root.  CSS & JS files for example will
		not work correctly if the url is: 
		localhost/view/category/blah
	Finish implementing the Usertype module, make it an enum that holds whatever?


Future Todo:
	IMPORTANT
	Research NoSQL databases which could be faster
		Maybe even redis

	Add search functionality
	
	Add a signup page

	Add pagination

	Build a search form with search term, min and max date(time), and tags

	Add editing and deletion capabilities for admins

	Add comments
	Add ability to reply to a specific comment
	Maybe add ability for admins to reply to a comment with a special styling, 
		like on newegg when companies reply to a comment about a problem
	Display a form allowing users to make new comments and edit and maybe delete their own



Research Futures
	try to implement caching by calling a function that returns a string and schedules an async function
	to write the string to a cache after the string is returned to allow the webpage to load while the 
	string is being written to the cache




Done
	Called init_pg_pool in main on program startup to avoid the extra 80ms delay it takes
	Changed user parameter from Option<UserCookie> to AdminCookie
	Added unauthorized_post()
