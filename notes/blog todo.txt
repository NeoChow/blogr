Blogr
	Change tags from text to character varying[] (array of varchars)
		Make a tag column that will be the new tags

	Maybe remove all the is_admin is_user username fields for the article templates
		Use javascript to add the edit/delete options
		But in the route check the correct cookie is set for that action
	
	Display a page that lists the tags, maybe even sort by number of posts each has
	
	Add unique visitors

	Authenticate user properly with a database query

	Change validation to use jQuery and Bootstrap - looks sooo pretty

	Posting articles: maybe add a javascript function to alert the user when spaces are detected in the tag field but no commas are found
		Display: Did you mean to use commas instead of spaces?

	CONVERT TO HANDLEBARS OR MUSTACHE TEMPLATES
	Customize the navigation link
	Make the menu link to:
	view
	tags - create new page that list the unique tags, maybe even sort by number of posts each has
	insert - for admins
	login - for users who are not logged in
		if user either admin or regular user do not display login, whichever cookie is set determines the userlevel
	signup - create signup page
	
	Eventually change the index page to list blog articles and show a login link elsewhere like in the nav

	Add custom <title> tag text for each page??
		Replace the title with a page specific one
		For /article?<aid> make the title equal to VishusBlog: <article title>

	Add a method/helper function to retrieve an article and user from a qry
		retrieve the data from the raw qry
		returns a result <Article/User, String>
		maybe make a trait that defines methods on Strings?? for retrieving stuff like
			.retrieve_article()
	
	Add Tls/Ssl using Let's Encrypt

		https://rocket.rs/guide/configuration/#configuring-tls
		https://api.rocket.rs/rocket/config/struct.Config.html#method.set_tls
	Sanitizing strings
	Make an actual layout
	Maybe implement a cache
	maybe implement a file cache
		This would allow files to be served even when the url
		is a folder in root.  CSS & JS files for example will
		not work correctly if the url is: 
		localhost/view/category/blah
	Finish implementing the Usertype module, make it an enum that holds whatever?


Design:
	Figure out a way to make the middle box backgrounds transparent and the outside black still
		This allows a static background to be placed that will move with the page, 
			staying in the same position on the screen at all times
			only the content boxes moves, allowing their inside to display the image

Future Todo:
	IMPORTANT
	Research NoSQL databases which could be faster
		Maybe even redis

	Add search functionality
	
	Add a signup page

	Add pagination

	Build a search form with search term, min and max date(time), and tags

	Add editing and deletion capabilities for admins

	Add comments
	Add ability to reply to a specific comment
	Maybe add ability for admins to reply to a comment with a special styling, 
		like on newegg when companies reply to a comment about a problem
	Display a form allowing users to make new comments and edit and maybe delete their own



Research Futures
	try to implement caching by calling a function that returns a string and schedules an async function
	to write the string to a cache after the string is returned to allow the webpage to load while the 
	string is being written to the cache




Done

	Maybe add a number of tabs at the beginning of each line of body text in the template() function
		The number of tabs to be determined by the layout
	
	IMPORTANT
	url_decode() the strings FromForm implementation for ArticleForm
		They are being saved as url_encoded() strings in the database

	JAVASCRIPT
	Add a second password box that has no placeholder text and has display: none
		when form is submitted set display: none to current password box and enable the hdiden one
	Also set submit button to disablabled after validating

	Style the insert form with bootstrap forms
	
	Auto resize the article body text box height when text height is larger than the box's

	Called init_pg_pool in main on program startup to avoid the extra 80ms delay it takes
	Changed user parameter from Option<UserCookie> to AdminCookie
	Added unauthorized_post()

	Add Description field
	
	Only show a shortened body or description for tag and view pages

	Make the template() function take a String instead of a &str
		The String will not be used anymore so its ok to move its ownership
		The &str needed to be converted to a String anyways
		NEVERMIND - passing in a &str is better
			Passing as a string needs to pass it as a reference anyways
			Only thing it does it erase the passed in variable when it doesnt need to
