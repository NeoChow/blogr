	IMPORTANT
	url_decode() the strings FromForm implementation for ArticleForm
		They are being saved as url_encoded() strings in the database

	JAVASCRIPT
	Add a second password box that has no placeholder text and has display: none
		when form is submitted set display: none to current password box and enable the hdiden one
	Also set submit button to disablabled after validating


	Add a method/helper function to retrieve an article and user from a qry
		retrieve the data from the raw qry
		returns a result <Article/User, String>
		maybe make a trait that defines methods on Strings?? for retrieving stuff like
			.retrieve_article()
	
	Add Tls/Ssl using Let's Encrypt

		https://api.rocket.rs/rocket/config/struct.Config.html#method.set_tls
	Sanitizing strings
	Make an actual layout
	Maybe implement a cache
	maybe implement a file cache
		This would allow files to be served even when the url
		is a folder in root.  CSS & JS files for example will
		not work correctly if the url is: 
		localhost/view/category/blah
	Finish implementing the Usertype module, make it an enum that holds whatever?


Future Todo:
	IMPORTANT
	Add search functionality
	
	Add comments
	Add ability to reply to a specific comment
	Maybe add ability for admins to reply to a comment with a special styling, 
		like on newegg when companies reply to a comment about a problem




Research Futures
	try to implement caching by calling a function that returns a string and schedules an async function
	to write the string to a cache after the string is returned to allow the webpage to load while the 
	string is being written to the cache




Done
	Called init_pg_pool in main on program startup to avoid the extra 80ms delay it takes
	Changed user parameter from Option<UserCookie> to AdminCookie
	Added unauthorized_post()
