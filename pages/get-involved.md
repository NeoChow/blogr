# Get Involved with Blogr

## About the Project
This project was started in mid 2017 by <script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">show_contact();</script><noscript>Andrew Prindle</noscript>.  Currently there are no others involved in this project, so if you are interested in getting involved or even just helping with ideas or bugs contact me using the above link or on GitHub (my username is vishusandy).  See the [About Me]({{base_url}}content/about-me) page for more info about me or [About Site]({{base_url}}content/about-site) for more information on this website..

The git repository is hosted on GitHub at [https://github.com/vishusandy/blogr](https://github.com/vishusandy/blogr).

## Project Design
The overall organization and design of the application is described in the [Blogr Design]({{base_url}}content/blogr-design) page or the older (but still valid and useful) [Blog Organization]({{base_url}}content/blog-organization) page.

#### Blog Setup
The website vishus.net is powered by this blog application running Postgresql and Nginx reverse proxy server.  There is not currently a How To Install document, but for now if you wish to setup your own install see [My Nginx Configuration]({{base_url}}content/nginx-site.conf), the [VPS Setup Guide]({{base_url}}content/setup-vps), [Rust Webserver Guide]({{base_url}}/content/rust-webserver), and [Linux Tips]({{base_url}}content/linux-tips).

As a side note you may also be interested in my [Rust themes]({{base_url}}content/sublime-theme) for Sublime Text and VS Code (Intellij coming in the future) and the various [Rust Tutorials]({{base_url}}content/tutorials) as well as the [Rust Snippets]({{base_url}}content/rust-snippets).
